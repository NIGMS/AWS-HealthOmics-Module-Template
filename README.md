# AWS-HealthOmics-Module-Template
Template repo for NIGMS Sandbox modules that use AWS HealthOmics

There are three branches included in this repo that demo three workflows: 
+ [fastqc](https://github.com/NIGMS/AWS-HealthOmics-Module-Template/tree/fastqc_demo)
+ [methylseq](https://github.com/NIGMS/AWS-HealthOmics-Module-Template/tree/methylseq_demo)
+ [scRNAseq](https://github.com/NIGMS/AWS-HealthOmics-Module-Template/tree/scrnaseq_demo)

Within each branch you can find instructions on how to clone and use the materials for that workflow.
